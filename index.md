-   **Mobile accessibility is covered in existing W3C WAI accessibility
    standards/guidelines**. There are not separate guidelines for mobile
    accessibility.
-   W3C is developing updated requirements and more specific guidance on
    mobile accessibility.
-   **WAI's [Mobile Accessibility Task
    Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/mobile-a11y-tf/) work includes:**

## More than "Mobile" {#intro}

"Mobile accessibility" refers to making websites and applications more
accessible to people with disabilities when they are using mobile phones
and other devices. WAI's work in this area addresses accessibility
issues of people using a broad range of devices to interact with the
web, including:

-   phones and tablets
-   digital TVs
-   wearables such as smart watches
-   devices in car dashboards and airplace seatbacks
-   devices in household appliances and other "Internet of Things"
-   and more

It address a wide range of issues, including:

-   touchscreens
-   small screen sizes
-   different input modalities, including voice and 3D touch enabled by
    pressure sensors
-   device use in a different settings, such as bright sunlight
-   and more

## W3C WAI Addresses Mobile Accessibility {#covered}

**WAI's accessibility standards address mobile accessibility**:

-   **[WCAG]({{ "/standards-guidelines/wcag/" | relative_url }})** (Web Content
    Accessibility Guidelines) covers web pages and web applications,
    including content used on mobile devices.
    -   To learn how WCAG 2.0 can be applied to mobile web content,
        mobile web apps, native apps, and hybrid apps using web
        components inside native apps, see [**Mobile Accessibility: How
        WCAG 2.0 and Other W3C/WAI Guidelines Apply to
        Mobile**](http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-accessibility-mapping/).
    -   A more general resource that also includes mobile apps is
        [WCAG2ICT: Applying WCAG 2.0 to Non-Web Information and
        Communications Technologies](http://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict/).
    -   WCAG 2.1 will have additional requirements related to mobile
        accessibility. We expect to complete it in 2018. The in-progress
        Working Draft is available: [WCAG 2.1 Working
        Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)
-   **[UAAG]({{ "/standards-guidelines/uaag/" | relative_url }})** (User Agent
    Accessibility Guidelines) covers web browsers and other 'user
    agents', including mobile browsers.
    -   For examples of how web browsers that follow UAAG benefit people
        with disabilities using the Web on mobile devices, see [Mobile
        Accessibility Examples from
        UAAG](http://www.w3.org/TR/IMPLEMENTING-UAAG20/mobile).
    -   For those wanting to explore the issues more, see [Applying UAAG
        to Mobile
        Phones](http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/work/wiki/Applying_UAAG_to_Mobile_Phones).
-   **[ATAG]({{ "/standards-guidelines/atag/" | relative_url }})** (Authoring Tool
    Accessibility Guidelines) covers software used to create web pages
    and applications, including for mobile.
-   **[WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php)** (Accessible
    Rich Internet Applications) defines ways to make web content more
    accessible, especially dynamic content and advanced user interface
    controls. It applies to web applications and to accessing websites
    with mobile devices.

WAI's Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG) is developing a
**Mobile Accessbility Introduction** with guidance for designers and
developers. We expect it to be completed in late 2018.

**W3C addresses mobile accessibility.** WAI ensures that the core W3C
technologies support accessibility, including those that are essential
for the mobile web. All W3C work is reviewed for accessibility by WAI's
Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group
([APA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/)).

W3C work on mobile includes [Mobile Web Application Best
Practices](http://www.w3.org/TR/mwabp/), [Mobile Web Best
Practices](http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/), and [mobileOK
Checker](http://validator.w3.org/mobile/). For a summary of technologies
developed in W3C that increase the capabilities of web applications and
how they apply specifically to the mobile context, see [Standards for
Web Applications on
Mobile](http://www.w3.org/Mobile/mobile-web-app-state/).

## Get Updates {#updates}

accessibility at W3C WAI, see [Getting WAI
Announcements](http://www.w3.org/WAI/about/announcements).

## Get Involved {#involved}

General information is available in [Participating in
WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/participation).

Most of WAI's work related to mobile accessibility is through the
[Mobile Accessibility Task
Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/mobile-a11y-tf/). If you would like to
be more involved in WAI's work on mobile accessibility, please send an
e-mail with information about your interests and time availability to
the Task Force facilitators [Kathy Wahlbin and Kim
Patch](mailto:kathy@interactiveaccessibility.com,Kim@redstartsystems.com?cc=wai@w3.org,shadi@w3.org&subject=Mobile%20Accessibility%20Task%20Force%20Enquiry) with CC to WAI Staff (wai@w3.org).

## About W3C and WAI {#about}

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international consortium where
Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to
develop Web standards. W3C primarily pursues its mission through the
creation of Web standards and guidelines designed to ensure long-term
growth for the Web. To learn more, see [About
W3C](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/).

W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) brings together individuals and
organizations from around the world to develop strategies, guidelines,
and resources to help make the Web accessible to people with
disabilities. To learn more, see the [WAI
website](http://www.w3.org/WAI/).
